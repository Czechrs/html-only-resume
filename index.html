      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://trine.edu/">Trine University</a> in Spring 2023 as a CSIT major. My goal at the end of school was to become a web developer. I realized that
        I would need some extra learning to be comfortable looking for a job, so I am actively working through a udemy course by <a href="https://twitter.com/yu_angela">Angela Yu</a>. </p>

      <h2>Work experience</h2>
      <p>I have worked several warehouse positions in past summers between school at Zachary's Confections, Walmart, and Hendrickson Trailer, however relevant work experience comes
      from my senior capstone project in university. Our project was a network security scanner using the censys api which scans the internet constantly to look for open ports on networks
      we made a tool that would help an IT administrator find their vulnerabilities. The project can be found here <a href="https://github.com/Offt3ch/SysGuard">Github</a></p>
